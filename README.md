# 🚲 Trail-Works Executive Sales Performance Dashboard (2016–2018)

A Power BI dashboard project focused on uncovering insights from Trail-Works’ sales data between 2016 and 2018. The goal was to analyze performance across products, regions, and sales reps—helping the business identify revenue drivers, performance gaps, and areas for strategic growth.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Working alongside the **Sales Strategy Manager**, I was tasked with analyzing sales and store performance over a 3-year period. This included identifying top-performing product categories, cities, states, and salespersons, while also evaluating traffic and order volume across stores.

The resulting **Executive Sales Performance Dashboard** enables strategic decision-making through visualized KPIs and trends.

## 🎯 Business Questions

- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- What states and cities contribute the most to sales?
- Who are the top-performing salespeople?
- What are the revenue trends from 2016 to 2018?
- Which stores attract the highest customer and order volumes?
